"""
Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', 
determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
 

Example 1:

Input: s = "()"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "()[]{}"
Output: true
Example 3:

Input: s = "(]"
Output: false
Example 4:

Input: s = "([)]"
Output: false
Example 5:

Input: s = "{[]}"
Output: true
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 104
s consists of parentheses only '()[]{}'.

Things to keep in mind:
What two data structures can you use to keep track of things easily?
What should you assert with each lookup?
Why do you need to check if stack[-1]?
Why should you return stack == []?
