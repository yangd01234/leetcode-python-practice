"""
You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product.
Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since
each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after 
a bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first bad
one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which returns whether version is
bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the
number of calls to the API.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 5, bad = 4
Output: 4
Explanation:
call isBadVersion(3) -> false
call isBadVersion(5) -> true
call isBadVersion(4) -> true
Then 4 is the first bad version.
Example 2:

Input: n = 1, bad = 1
Output: 1
 

Constraints:

1 <= bad <= n <= 231 - 1

Things to keep in mind:
What should you assert?
What type of search is the fastest?
With this type of search, how do you keep checking until you find the right answer?
What are some things to look out for when you find a "True" value?
What shold you return to resolve the last question?
