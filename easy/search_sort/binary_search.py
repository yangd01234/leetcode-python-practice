"""
Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9
Output: 4
Explanation: 9 exists in nums and its index is 4
Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: 2 does not exist in nums so return -1
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 104
-9999 <= nums[i], target <= 9999
All the integers in nums are unique.

Things to keep in mind:
What do you need to modify for the pointers after you divide by 2?
Why is it important to increment?
